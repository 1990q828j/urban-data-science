# Urban Data Science

In this repo I have compiled a cycle of course materials, IPython notebooks, and tutorials 
towards an urban data science course based on Python.

Some of these course materials and their sequencing have been adapted from materials I previously 
taught in [CP255: Urban Informatics and Visualization](https://github.com/waddell/urban-informatics-and-visualization) at UC Berkeley.
