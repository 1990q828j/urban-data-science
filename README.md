# Urban Data Science

In this repo I have compiled a cycle of course materials, IPython notebooks, and tutorials for an urban data science course based on Python.

Some of these course materials and the sequencing have been adapted from materials I previously taught in CP255: Urban Informatics and Visualization at UC Berkeley.
